                <h2>Performance Data Recorder</h2>
<p>Record, share and analyze your driving experiences on and
off the track with the industry-exclusive Performance Data Recorder1.
Add an extra dimension to your drive by logging video of your drives, along with real-time performance data,
on an SD memory card stored in the glove box. Four modes — Track, Sport, Touring and Performance — allow you to capture
video, audio, driving stats, date and time, and a lot more.  </p>

<h2>Intelligent interior design</h2>
<p>Stingray’s interior space is pure and dynamic, with a single sweeping contour unifying 
instrument console and panel, and door trim. The smaller, 360mm super-tight
steering wheel gives you a more direct, race-track feel.  </p>

<p>This system also houses the 20GB hard drive and hosts the ConnectedDrive Services which includes BMW Apps, 
BMW Emergency Call, BMW Teleservices, BMW Online Services, Information Plus and Remote Services. </p>

<p>Of course all of the above is controlled via the firm’s iDrive interface, and the cabin is cooled and heated 
(remotely if you wish) by a dual-zone climate control system. On the move you’ll notice the colour head up display, 
though be aware that with some polarised sunglasses the information becomes invisible, the dynamic cruise control, 
variable dampers, front and rear parking sensors, automatically dimming rear view mirror and a rain sensor for the lights
and wipers. </p>

<p>Those lights are adaptive LED items, and compliment the layered glass exterior design and standard 20-inch alloy wheels, 
black brake calipers, and blue accent detailing. </p>

<p>Every owner can take advantage of the BMW Apps Interface, which allows owners to monitor the state of the car’s charge, 
whether the lights, windows, boot or doors are open or on as well as browse previous trip information remotely from their 
smartphone. A remote control function allows the car to be pre-heated or cooled before setting off, as well as searching and 
locating charging points before starting the journey

                </div>
                    <center><p>When it comes to options there’s not much choice for the i8, but the easiest way to make 
                    your example look different is to change the paint from Sophisto Grey (standard) to Ionic 
                    Silver or Protonic Blue (both £450) or Crystal White (£1,350). All wheels are 20-inches, 
                    but there are two different styles to choose from (W-Spoke at £1,150 and Turbine-Spoke at £1,380).</p></center>

<center><p>Blue seat belts will set you back £310, an anthracite headlining £295, while the upgraded 
Harman/Kardon stereo adds another £895 to the list price. Choose the Driving Assistant with Surround-view 
camera and High-beam assistant for the lights for £1,490 while the eDrive exterior sound option 
(so pedestrians can hear you coming when in electric mode) will set you back £85.</p></center>

<center><p>There’s the option to change the interior trim as well, with the Carpo Interior World 
scheme (£1,150) or Halo Interior World (£2,150), the latter adding a leather that has been
tanned with Olive leaf extract for those with an eco-conscience. </p></center>

<center><p>From November 2014 the BMW i8 will be offered with the option of Laserlights, which 
double the high-beam range of traditional LED headlights but consume 1/3 less energy. The BMW 
360 degree Electric Products and Services includes Service Inclusive, BMW i Mobile care, and the 
option to add a specially designed BMW i Wallbox for your home.</p></center>

<center><p>A Pure Impulse Design Package takes the standard interior scheme and lifts it one step 
further with blue accents, Amido metallic trim and details in Pearl Gloss and Chrome, as well
as an Anthracite headlining. It costs over £10,000 but also allows you to fully immerse yourself 
in the exclusive BMW i dream, should you want to, allowing membership to the Pure Impulse Programme 
inviting owners to eat in the fanciest restaurants, stay at the swankiest hotels and experience money-can’t buy events.</p></center>
